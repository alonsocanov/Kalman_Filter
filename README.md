# Kalman Filter


This repository is a classic Kalman Filter in order to predict its possible possition when the ball is occluded.  

 


## Run code
First activate the virtual environment if you use one, make sure that you have required libraries and run the folowing command:  

```bash
python3 path/to/directory/test_kf.py
```

## Libraries
- cv2
- numpy
- sys
- os
- glob
- imutils
- argparse
